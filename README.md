## About Kangoo

Kangoo is an open-source e-commerce platform designed to explore and demonstrate the microservices architectural model and the technologies that support it. Developed using Java and Spring Boot, Kangoo aims to provide a learning platform for developers interested in microservices, containerization, and cloud deployment.

The project is developed in my spare time with the goal of understanding microservices architecture in-depth and mastering the technologies around it.

## Goal

The primary goal of Kangoo is to serve as an educational tool for developers to learn about microservices architecture. It's designed to showcase the end-to-end development and deployment of microservices in a realistic scenario. Through Kangoo, I aim to explore:

- The intricacies of designing and implementing microservices
- Containerization and orchestration with Docker
- Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines
- Cloud deployment strategies

## Technology Stack

Kangoo is built with the following technologies:

- **Spring Boot 3**: For creating microservices
- **Java 21**: As the programming language
- **Docker**: For containerizing the microservices
- **Maven**: For managing project dependencies
- **Git**: For version control

## Features

Kangoo is still under development, and the current focus is on building the core microservices, including:

- **Customers Service**: To manage customer data
- **Products Service**: To manage product listings
- **Orders Service**: For handling customer orders
- **Identity Service**: For authentication and authorization

Future enhancements will include:

- Implementing a robust CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- Cloud deployment of the entire platform
- Addition of more microservices for features like payment processing and inventory management
